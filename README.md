# pitt_revision

The current version is dirty.....
Will clean and reconstruct a lot of data structures once I got time for it....


The current thing I am doing:
Keep adding new stuff into the framework, at least have a tool that is available for usage despite the dirty data structure and framework design

What the tool has for now:
1. A GUI tool for annotating revisions
2. A revision analysis tool for classifying revisions
	(You need to have the training data)
	Input: pairs of raw text
	Output: aligned and classified revisions presented in Excel format
